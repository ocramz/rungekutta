This is a small module collecting about a dozen Runge-Kutta methods
of different orders, along with a couple of programs to exercise them.

Build and run testrk, volterra, volterra2, and arenstorf:

o   testrk exercises all of the methods in a non-adaptive way,
    solving a test problem with a known analytic solution,
    to check convergence. (This was what first indicated that
    there was a problem with the Fehlberg 7(8) listing in HNW.)

o   volterra uses a non-adaptive method to solve the Lotka-Volterra
    equations from t=0 to t=40: either from a built-in starting point,
    or from a starting point specified on the command line.

o   volterra2 does the same, except it uses an adaptive solver

o   arenstorf solves the restricted 3-body problem (earth+moon+satellite)
    using an adaptive solver with some specific initial conditions
    which yield periodic orbits

The volterra2 and arenstorf examples use an "oracle" function to
decide what is a good step size. Right now that oracle function is in
each test file; arguably it should be in the RungeKutta module.
Eventually it will be, but I haven't spent much time yet on making
that oracle especially good.
